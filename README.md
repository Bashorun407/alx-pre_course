My first readme

Creating files on this repository has increased my knowledge in the use of emacs to write data into files.
I have also learnt to use git hub to add files, commit files and push files to git hub repository.
I am still pushing data into the repository. I can not push up_to_date file to this repository for some reasons I am yet to find out.
